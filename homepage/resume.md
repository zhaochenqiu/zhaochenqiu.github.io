Summary
-------

Hi, welcome to my homepage, i am a researcher as well as a developer of
computer vision who is currently working as a research associate in Institute
for Media Innovation, IMI, Singapore, Nanyang Technological University, NTU. My
research interests include Background Subtraction, Video Segmentation, Pattern
Recognition, Machine Learning and Deep Learning. For programming part, i used
to take part in several projects and also led the development of a few practical
projects. Personally, i love programming very much, and C/C++ is my favorite language.
More information about me are available as follows:
